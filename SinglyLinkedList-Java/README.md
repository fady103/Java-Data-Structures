## 🧠 Operations & Complexity

| Operation           | Time Complexity |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Append              | O(n)             |
| Prepend             | O(1)             |
| Insert At           | O(n)             |
| Delete First        | O(1)             |
| Delete Last         | O(n)             |
| Delete At           | O(n)             |
| Search              | O(n)             |
| Print               | O(n)             |
